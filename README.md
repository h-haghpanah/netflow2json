# Netflow V9 Traffic Analysis

## Overview

The **Netflow Traffic Analysis** project is a Python-based solution for collecting and analyzing Netflow V9 traffic data. This documentation provides a detailed guide on how to set up, configure, and use the code for collecting Netflow data and performing traffic analysis. It also explains how to access the results via a web service.

## Installation

To get started with the Netflow Traffic Analysis code, follow these installation steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netflow-traffic-analysis.git
   cd netflow-traffic-analysis
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install them.

   ```bash
   pip install netaddr
   pip install netflow
   pip install flask
   ```

## Configuration

The code is configured through a `config.ini` file. To customize the behavior of the code, edit this configuration file.

### Configuration File (config.ini)

The config.ini file contains three sections: [Network], [Netflow], and [Web]. Customize these settings as needed.

#### [Network]

The `[Network]` section is used to define local IP address ranges. The code uses these ranges to categorize Netflow traffic as "Local," "Upload," or "Download."

- **`ranges`**: Specify a list of IP address ranges in CIDR notation. Traffic within these ranges is categorized as "Local."

  Example:

  ```ini
  [Network]
  ranges = 192.168.0.0/24, 172.16.11.0/24, 172.16.12.0/24, 172.16.13.0/24, 172.16.14.0/24, 172.16.16.0/24
  ```

#### [Netflow]

The `[Netflow]` section contains configuration options related to Netflow traffic collection.

- **`port`**: Specify the port (UDP) on which the code listens for incoming Netflow v9 traffic.

  Example:

  ```ini
  [Netflow]
  port = 2055
  ```
#### [Web]

The `[Web]` section contains configuration options related to the web service.

- **`port`**: Specify the port on which the web service is accessible.

  Example:

  ```ini
  [Web]
  port = 80
  ```


## Usage

To run the Netflow Traffic Analysis code and start collecting and analyzing Netflow v9 data, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Code**

   Start the code to listen for incoming Netflow v9 traffic:

   ```bash
   python analyser.py
   ```

2. **Netflow Analysis**

   The code parses and analyzes incoming Netflow v9 data. It categorizes traffic into "Local," "Upload," or "Download" based on the configured IP address ranges.

3. **Web Service**

   Access the web service to view the collected Netflow data and analysis results.

4. **Test Scenario**

   The code contains a test scenario that demonstrates its capabilities.

## Sample Output

Here is an example of the JSON response generated by the code:

```json
{
  "traffic_type": "Local",
  "src_ip": "192.168.1.1",
  "dst_ip": "203.0.113.42",
  "bytes": 10240,
  "packets": 50,
  "src_port": 12345,
  "dst_port": 80,
  "timestamp": "2023-10-18 15:30:45",
  "protocol": 6
}
```

This JSON response provides information about the traffic type, source and destination IPs, bytes transferred, packets, ports, timestamp, and protocol.
